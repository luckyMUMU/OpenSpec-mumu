# Deep Path Workflow

> **版本**: v1.0.0

## Input

```markdown
## Task
[Feature/Refactor description]

## Context
- Type: [new/refactor/api/architecture]
- Scope: [cross-file/modules]
- Constraints: [constraints]
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis

**Purpose**: Clarify requirements

**Actions**:
1. Multi-round dialogue with user
2. Generate PRD
3. 6-dimension analysis
4. Get user confirmation

**Stop Point**: `[WAITING_FOR_REQUIREMENTS]`

### Step 2: Code Audit (Optional)

**Purpose**: Impact assessment

**Actions**:
1. Analyze existing code
2. Identify dependencies
3. Assess impact scope

### Step 3: Architecture Design

**Purpose**: Technology-agnostic design

**Actions**:
1. Design system architecture
2. Write pseudocode
3. Define interfaces
4. Record decisions

**Stop Point**: `[WAITING_FOR_ARCHITECTURE]`

### Step 4: Architecture Review

**Purpose**: Quality assurance

**Actions**:
1. Review 6 dimensions
2. Identify issues
3. Multi-round iteration

**Max**: 3 rounds

**Stop Points**:
- Pass: `[ARCHITECTURE_PASSED]`
- Deadlock: `[USER_DECISION]`

### Step 5: Implementation Design

**Purpose**: Project-specific design

**Actions**:
1. Map to tech stack
2. Compare options
3. Create task list
4. Define interfaces

**Stop Point**: `[WAITING_FOR_DESIGN]`

### Step 6: Code Implementation

**Purpose**: Physical coding

**Actions**:
1. Create checkpoint
2. Implement by design
3. Run tests
4. Quality checks

**Stop Point**: Show diff for review

### Step 7: Document Maintenance

**Purpose**: Sync docs

**Actions**:
1. Update parent indexes
2. Sync cross-references
3. Mark `[completed]`

## Output

```markdown
## Deep Path Complete

### Stages Completed
- [x] Requirement Analysis
- [x] Architecture Design
- [x] Architecture Review
- [x] Implementation Design
- [x] Code Implementation
- [x] Document Maintenance

### Artifacts
- PRD: [path]
- Architecture: [path]
- Implementation: [path]
- Code: [changes]

### Status
`[completed]`
```

## Constraints

- Must follow all stages
- Must pass reviews
- 3-strike rule applies
- Document must sync

## 3-Strike Rule

| Strike | Condition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Implementation fails | Auto-fix |
| 2 | Fails again | Audit + redesign |
| 3 | Fails again | **Break**, user decision |
